<h2>Efficient Road Crossing System </h2>
<p><i>The road crossing system based on IoT is a smart and efficient solution designed to manage and
control pedestrian and vehicular traffic at intersections. The system uses a network of sensors and
cameras to collect real-time data on traffic flow and pedestrian activity, and then uses this data to
optimize traffic signals, reduce congestion, and improve safety.</i></p>
