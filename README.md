<h2>Efficient Road Crossing System </h2>
<p><i>Pedestrians and vehicles often share the same road, and crossing the road can be dangerous for
pedestrians. It is essential to ensure the safety of pedestrians while allowing the smooth flow of
traffic. However, traditional road crossing systems are often inadequate, and accidents can still
occur due to human error or malfunctioning of the system.<br>
  
An “IoT-based Efficient road crossing system”can address these issues by using sensors and
other IoT devices to monitor the road and get a safe road crossing path. The system can detect the
presence vehicles and adjust the traffic lights to ensure safe and efficient crossing. Therefore, the
problem statement is to design and develop an IoT-based road crossing system that can detect and
respond to the presence of pedestrians and vehicles, ensuring safe and efficient crossing for all
road users.<br>

The primary objective of “IoT based Efficient road crossing system” is to detect the presence of
vehicles on the road and an LDR to sense the ambient light conditions. Based on this information,
the system controls the traffic signals using the LED lights and emits a warning sound through the
buzzer to alert pedestrians when it is safe to cross the road.</i></p>

<p>PS: The prototype of the project is for one-way road. To use it for two-way, repeat similar steps of connection on other side.
To make it cost efficient for two-way, use Arduino MEGA instead of Arduino UNO. But the connections for Arduino MEGA may differ.
